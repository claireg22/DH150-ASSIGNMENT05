## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling puts a human face on dry data and research and ensures that the improvements made in the product are user-centered. A good experience is like telling a good story - it places our product into a scenerio and allows us to visualize our product being used. From there, we will be able to understand why our product is used, how it can be used to resolve conflicts in our user's lives, and how users may feel when they use the product. UX storytelling requires developers to define the user and create stories around them and their goals. Developers are able to empathize with these personalized stories to better understand their user's emotional experiences as they use the product. In all, UX storytelling provides insight into potential users, allows for a simplified and personable method of presenting product information, and highlights the potential user scenerios applicable to the product.

### Austin's Scenario
• Austin Chen is a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA. He still lives on The Hill (the dorms) and is a Computer Science and Statistics double major, meaning he has double the amount of work to study. Before college, he used to play sports, but after picking up an additional major, he has to spend most of his day and free time studying for his exam or working on an assignment. He never has time to go to the gym. However, he still wants to keep active during his study breaks and is looking to purchase exercise equipment to use in his dorm room. Since he does not have enough free time to leave campus to uber to the nearest sports store, which is a 50 min. drive away, and he also does not want to carry any heavy equipment to his dorm, he decides to shop online. Austin does not have a specific sports equipment he has in mind, but he hopes to find something quick so he can get back to studying.
• Austin opens up Amazon in a new tab during his short study break. He types "exercise equipment" in the search bar at the top of the main page and presses the button with the magnifying glass icon to search for results. The page refreshes to show a grid of categories that have grouped the results, such as "hand-weights," "stretching equipment,""exercise machines,""cardio,""lower-body strength," "upper-body strength", and "core strength." Below the grid of categories is a list of all potential "exercise equipment" results. Austin feels satisfied when he sees the categories because he can now choose what kind of equipment he wants to purchase. After reading the list of categories, Austin determines that he wants to improve his core muscles and clicks the box around "core strength" which leads him into a page with all of the results for exercise equipment relating to strengthening the core. Austin is instrigued with the diverse set of results because he did not know that some of these equipments existed. He finds the product he wants to purchase, he clicks the item's picture and he clicks the button "Add to Cart" to purchase the item. Austin returns back to his Statistics homework feeling excited about his new equipment arriving in the mail and pleased that he was able to decide what kind of equipment he wanted and purchase the product very quickly.
